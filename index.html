            <h2>MP Clash</h2>
            <p><strong>Card Distribution:</strong> All the cards are dealt as evenly as possible to each player. If there’s an odd number of cards, one player may receive one more card than the others.</p>
            <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Each player has their own stack of cards. In each round, every player plays one card from the top of their stack, face-up. The card they play should be randomly chosen, not picked intentionally.</p>
            <p><strong>Winning the Round:</strong> The player with the highest Military Power (MP) value on their card wins the round and takes all the cards that were played that round. For example, if Player 1 plays a card with 30 MP, Player 2 plays a card with 25 MP, and Player 3 plays a card with 20 MP, Player 1 wins the round and takes all the cards.</p>
            <p><strong>Out of Cards?:</strong> Flip all of your used cards over, shuffle them, and continue playing.</p>
            <p><strong>Tie Scenario:</strong> If there is a tie (i.e., two or more players play cards with the same MP value), the tied players each play one card face down, then another card face-up. The player with the highest MP on the second face-up card wins all the cards played that round.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to win all the cards from the other players, so the last player left with all the cards wins the game.</p>

            <h2>Trivia Country Grab</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Be the player with the most Country Cards at the end of the game by answering trivia questions correctly and grabbing cards from the deck.</p>
            <p><strong>Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Country Cards:</strong> 50 cards, each representing a different country. These cards are shuffled and placed face down in the center of the table (the "deck").</li>
                <li><strong>Trivia Questions:</strong> A stack of trivia questions that all players can answer. These are general trivia questions, not country-specific.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Shuffle the 50 Country Cards and place them face down in the center of the table in a pile.</li>
                <li>Prepare a set of Trivia Question Cards (these can be printed or written out ahead of time). The trivia questions should be general knowledge (e.g., “What is the capital of France?” or “Which planet is known as the Red Planet?”).</li>
                <li>Decide who will go first.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask a Question:</strong> The first player (the trivia master) asks a trivia question aloud to all players.</li>
                <li><strong>Answering the Question:</strong> The first player to answer the question correctly gets the chance to grab a Country Card from the top of the deck. If no one answers correctly, the trivia master asks the same or a new question until someone answers it correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Grabbing a Card:</strong> Once a player answers correctly, they immediately pick the top card from the pile of Country Cards and add it to their collection. The deck is reshuffled after each card is taken, keeping the game dynamic.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> The trivia master continues asking questions, and players continue answering and grabbing cards, until all 50 Country Cards have been handed out.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The player with the most Country Cards at the end of the game wins. If there's a tie in the number of cards, a tiebreaker question can be asked to determine the winner.</p>

            <h2>Asia Explorer</h2>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Draw a Card:</strong> A deck of Country Cards is placed face-down in the center of the table. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck and reads the country's name aloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Locate the Country:</strong> The player must then point to the country's location on the map:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exact Match:</strong> If the player correctly identifies the exact location of the country, they earn <strong>3 points</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bordering Match:</strong> If the player selects a country that directly borders the correct country, they earn <strong>1 point</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorrect Guess:</strong> If the player guesses incorrectly, they earn <strong>0 points</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Next Player:</strong> Play continues clockwise, with each player taking turns drawing a card and guessing.</li>
